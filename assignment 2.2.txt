Difference between Interpreter and Compiler?
Interpreter : 
1.Interpreter translates program one statement at a time.
2.It take less amount of time to analyze the source code,but overall exuction time is slow.
3.No intermediate object code is generated.
4.It continue the program until it meets first error
5.Memory requirement is less.
Example : BASIC.

Compiler : 
1.Compiler scans entire program and translates it into machine code.
2.It take large amount of time to analyze the source code,but excution time is fast.
3.Intermediate object is generated.
4.It generates the error message after scanning whole program.
5.Memory requirement is more.
Example : C Compiler.
